# GAME: Angry-Animals
This game is my attempt at learning how to use RigidBody2D nodes in Godot. 
The game is similar to Angry Birds, but instead of knocking down pigs, you have to get the bird
inside of the buckets! The game's logic is all set, and with a bit of knowledge of Godot
(and a lot of copy and pasting assets), levels can easily be added onto this game!
